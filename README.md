# Automobile Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze an automobile dataset to explore relationships between various factors such as car length, mileage, body style, and engine types. The goal is to provide insights into how these attributes influence car design, performance, and fuel efficiency. The analysis helps in understanding the patterns that can guide consumers in making informed decisions based on their preferences for body style, mileage, and engine type.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the unique categories in the dataset, such as car companies, body styles, and engine types.
  
- **Missing Values Analysis**: Identifying and handling missing data in the dataset to ensure accuracy.

- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing different car attributes, including length, mileage, body style, and engine type, to reveal trends and patterns.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the correlation between car length and mileage to understand the trade-offs between size and fuel efficiency.

- **Insights on Body Styles**: Evaluating how different body styles (hatchback, sedan, convertible, etc.) relate to mileage and length, providing buyers with data-driven insights.

## Summary of Findings

- **Hatchbacks**: Typically compact, offering better mileage.
  
- **Sedans/Wagons**: Vary in size but generally provide good mileage.

- **Convertibles**: Medium-length cars with relatively good mileage.

- **Hardtops**: Usually longer cars with lower mileage.

These insights are valuable for both car manufacturers and buyers, providing a deeper understanding of how design choices impact performance and efficiency.
